-----------------------------------------------

This directory contains the training set for
The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Used in this project

However, it can be used for any classifier
desired by the person using the code and
additionally, it is not limited to a specific
traffic sign templates.

Content
----------------------------------------------

The number of example is based on the number:
->of traffic signs that were used as templates
->of the image manipulation processes
->of the brighness variations values used
->of the blending procedures


----------------------------------------------
Image format and naming
----------------------------------------------
The images created are of "jpg" format
with RGBA channels

   SIGN_X/XXX_YYY.jpg

The initial part (X) is used to distinguish the
sign class, while the remaining (XXX_YYY) firstly
indicated the sign in the file itself and the
example number.
